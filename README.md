linux-setup
============

This is my personal equivalent of other people's dotfiles repository.
Most of what is in here is quite outdated, but keeping it around for my own
reference.

When I started this back in 2014, configuration management systems like puppet
and ansible weren't as widespread as they are today.

At the time I wrote a bunch of install.sh scripts in the various subdirectories
of this repository, at some point in the future I'd like to redo these to use
something like ansible.
